    <section id="cid1" type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><para id="id62175">All the objects that we see in the world around us, are made of <emphasis effect="bold">matter</emphasis>. Matter makes up the air we breathe, the ground we walk on, the food we eat and the animals and plants that live around us. Even our own human bodies are made of matter!</para>
      <para id="id62185">Different objects can be made of different types of matter, or <emphasis effect="bold">materials</emphasis>. For example, a cupboard (an <emphasis effect="italics">object</emphasis>) is made of wood, nails and hinges (the <emphasis effect="italics">materials</emphasis>). The <emphasis effect="bold">properties</emphasis> of the materials will affect the properties of the object. In the example of the cupboard, the strength of the wood and metals make the cupboard strong and durable. In the same way, the raincoats that you wear during bad weather, are made of a material that is waterproof. The electrical wires in your home are made of metal because metals are a type of material that is able to conduct electricity. It is very important to understand the properties of materials, so that we can use them in our homes, in industry and in other applications. In this chapter, we will be looking at different types of materials and their properties.</para>
<para id="id0132">Some of the properties of matter that you should know are:
<list id="lid825"><item><label>Strength</label>Materials can be strong and resist bending (e.g. iron rods, cement) or weak (e.g. fabrics)</item>
<item><label>Thermal and electrical conductivity</label>Materials that conduct heat (e.g. metals) are called thermal conductors. Materials that conduct electricity are electrical conductors.</item>
<item><label>Brittle, malleable or ductile</label>Brittle materials break easily. Materials that are malleable can be easily formed into different shapes. Ductile materials are able to be formed into long wires.</item>
<item><label>Magnetic or non-magnetic</label>Magnetic materials have a magnetic field.</item>
<item><label>Density</label>Density is the mass per unit volume. An example of a dense material is concrete.</item>
<item><label>Boiling and melting points</label>The boiling and melting points of substance help us to classify substances as solids, liquids or gases at a specific temperature.</item>
</list>
</para>
      <para id="id62556">The diagram below shows one way in which matter can be classified (grouped) according to its different properties. As you read further in this chapter, you will see that there are also other ways of classifying materials, for example according to whether or not they are good electrical conductors.</para>

    <para id="eip-344"><title>Discussion: Everyday materials</title>In groups of 3 or 4 look at the labels of medicines, food items, and any other items that you use often. What can you tell about the material inside the container from the list of ingredients? Why is it important to have a list of ingredients on the materials that we use? Do some research on the safety data of the various compounds in the items that you looked at. Are the compounds in the items safe to use? In the food items, what preservatives and additives are there? Are these preservatives and additives good for you? Are there natural alternatives (natural alternatives are usually used by indigenous people groups)? </para><section id="cid2"><title>Mixtures</title><para id="id62584">We see mixtures all the time in our everyday lives. A stew, for example, is a mixture of different foods such as meat and vegetables; sea water is a mixture of water, salt and other substances, and air is a mixture of gases such as carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen.</para>
<definition id="fhsst_id69"><term id="termfhsst_id69"> Mixture </term> <meaning id="meaningfhsst_id69">
      A <emphasis effect="bold">mixture</emphasis> is a combination of two or more substances, where these substances are not bonded (or joined) to each other. 
      </meaning></definition>
      <para id="id62612">In a mixture, the substances that make up the mixture:</para>
      <list id="id62615" display="block" list-type="bulleted">
        <item id="uid2"><emphasis effect="italics">are not in a fixed ratio</emphasis>
Imagine, for example, that you have a 250 ml beaker of water. It doesn't matter whether you add 20 g, 40 g, 100 g or any other mass of sand to the water; it will still be called a mixture of sand and water.
</item>
        <item id="uid3"><emphasis effect="italics">keep their physical properties</emphasis>
In the example we used of the sand and water, neither of these substances has changed in any way when they are mixed together. Even though the sand is in water, it still has the same properties as when it was out of the water.
</item>
        <item id="uid4"><emphasis effect="italics">can be separated by mechanical means</emphasis>
To separate something by 'mechanical means', means that there is no chemical process involved. In our sand and water example, it is possible to separate the mixture by simply pouring the water through a filter. Something <emphasis effect="italics">physical</emphasis> is done to the mixture, rather than something <emphasis effect="italics">chemical</emphasis>.
</item>
      </list>
      <para id="id62689">Some other examples of mixtures include blood (a mixture of blood cells, platelets and plasma), steel (a mixture of iron and other materials) and the gold that is used to make jewellery. The gold in jewellery is not pure gold but is a mixture of metals. The amount of gold in the jewellery is measured in <emphasis effect="italics">karats</emphasis> (24 karat would be pure gold, while 18 karat is only 75% gold).</para>
      <para id="id62700">We can group mixtures further by dividing them into those that are heterogeneous and those that are homogeneous.</para>
      <section id="uid5">
        <title>Heterogeneous mixtures</title>
        <para id="id62715">A <emphasis effect="bold">heterogeneous</emphasis> mixture does not have a definite composition. Think of a pizza, that has a topping of cheese, tomato, mushrooms and peppers (the topping is a mixture). Each slice will probably be slightly different from the next because the toppings (the tomato, cheese, mushrooms and peppers) are not evenly distributed. Another example would be granite, a type of rock. Granite is made up of lots of different mineral substances including quartz and feldspar. But these minerals are not spread evenly through the rock and so some parts of the rock may have more quartz than others. Another example is a mixture of oil and water. Although you may add one substance to the other, they will stay separate in the mixture. We say that these heterogeneous mixtures are <emphasis effect="italics">non-uniform</emphasis>, in other words they are not exactly the same throughout.</para>
<definition id="fhsst_id89"><term id="termfhsst_id89"> Heterogeneous mixture </term> <meaning id="meaningfhsst_id89">
        A heterogeneous mixture is one that is non-uniform and the different components of the mixture can be seen.
        </meaning></definition>
      </section>
      <section id="uid6">
        <title>Homogeneous mixtures</title>
        <para id="id62762">A <emphasis effect="bold">homogeneous</emphasis> mixture has a definite composition, and specific properties. In a homogeneous mixture, the different parts cannot be seen. A solution of salt dissolved in water is an example of a homogeneous mixture. When the salt dissolves, it will spread evenly through the water so that all parts of the solution are the same, and you can no longer see the salt as being separate from the water. Think also of a powdered drink that you mix with water. Provided you give the container a good shake after you have added the powder to the water, the drink will have the same sweet taste for anyone who drinks it, it won't matter whether they take a sip from the top or from the bottom. The air we breathe is another example of a homogeneous mixture since it is made up of different gases which are in a constant ratio, and which can't be visually distinguished from each other (i.e. you can't see the different components).</para>
<definition id="fhsst_id96"><term id="termfhsst_id96"> Homogeneous mixture </term> <meaning id="meaningfhsst_id96">
        A homogeneous mixture is one that is uniform, and where the different components of the mixture cannot be seen. 
        </meaning></definition>
        <para id="id62795">An <emphasis effect="bold">alloy</emphasis> is a homogeneous mixture of two or more elements, at least one of which is a metal, where the resulting material has metallic properties. Alloys are usually made to improve the properties of the elements that make them up. For example steel is much stronger than iron (which is the main component of steel).</para>

      <title>Pure Substances: Elements and Compounds</title>
      <para id="id63273">Any material that is not a mixture, is called a <emphasis effect="bold">pure substance</emphasis>. Pure substances include <emphasis effect="bold">elements</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">compounds</emphasis>. It is much more difficult to break down pure substances into their parts, and complex chemical methods are needed to do this.</para>
      <para id="eip-862">One way to determine if a substance is pure is to look at its melting or boiling point. Pure substances will have a sharply defined melting or boiling point (i.e. the melting or boiling point will be a single temperature rather than a range of temperatures.) Impure substances have a temperature range over which they melt or boil. We can also use chromatography to determine if a substance is pure or not. Chromatography is the process of separating substances into their individual components. If a substance is pure then chromatography will only produce one substance at the end of the process. If a substance is impure then several substances will be seen at the end of the process. </para><para id="eip-122"><title>Activity: Smartie chromatography</title>You will need filter paper (or chromatography paper), some smarties in different colours, water and an eye dropper. <newline/>
Place a smartie in the center of a piece of filter paper. Carefully drop a few drops of water onto the smartie. You should see rings of different colour forming around the smartie. Each colour is one of the individual colours that are used to make up the colour of the smartie.</para><note id="eip-392">For the above activity you can use ordinary filter paper (that is used in coffee filters) from your local store.</note><section id="uid25">
        <title>Elements</title>
        <para id="id63302">An <emphasis effect="bold">element</emphasis> is a chemical substance that can't be divided or changed into other chemical substances by any ordinary chemical means. The smallest unit of an element is the <emphasis effect="bold">atom</emphasis>.</para>
<definition id="fhsst_id193"><term id="termfhsst_id193"> Element </term> <meaning id="meaningfhsst_id193">
        An element is a substance that cannot be broken down into other substances through chemical means.
        </meaning></definition>
        <para id="id63334">There are 112 officially named elements and about 118 known elements. Most of these are natural, but some are man-made. The elements we know are represented in the <emphasis effect="bold">Periodic Table of the Elements</emphasis>, where each element is abbreviated to a <emphasis effect="bold">chemical symbol</emphasis>. Examples of elements are magnesium (<m:math><m:mi mathvariant="normal">Mg</m:mi></m:math>), hydrogen (<m:math><m:mi mathvariant="normal">H</m:mi></m:math>), oxygen (<m:math><m:mi mathvariant="normal">O</m:mi></m:math>) and carbon (<m:math><m:mi mathvariant="normal">C</m:mi></m:math>). On the Periodic Table you will notice that some of the abbreviations do not seem to match the elements they represent. The element iron, for example, has the chemical formula <m:math><m:mi mathvariant="normal">Fe</m:mi></m:math>. This is because the elements were originally given Latin names. Iron has the abbreviation <m:math><m:mi mathvariant="normal">Fe</m:mi></m:math> because its Latin name is 'ferrum'. In the same way, sodium's Latin name is 'natrium' (<m:math><m:mi mathvariant="normal">Na</m:mi></m:math>) and gold's is 'aurum' (<m:math><m:mi mathvariant="normal">Au</m:mi></m:math>).</para><note id="eip-775"><title>Interesting fact</title>Recently it was agreed that two more elements would be added to the list of officially named elements.

        <title>Compounds</title>
        <para id="id63363">A <emphasis effect="bold">compound</emphasis> is a chemical substance that forms when two or more elements combine in a fixed ratio. Water (<m:math overflow="scroll"><m:mi mathvariant="normal">H</m:mi><m:msub><m:mrow/><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msub><m:mi mathvariant="normal">O</m:mi></m:math>), for example, is a compound that is made up of two hydrogen atoms for every one oxygen atom. Sodium chloride (<m:math><m:mi>NaCl</m:mi></m:math>) is a compound made up of one sodium atom for every chlorine atom. An important characteristic of a compound is that it has a <emphasis effect="bold">chemical formula</emphasis>, which describes the ratio in which the atoms of each element in the compound occur.</para>

Iron (Fe) and sulphur (S) are two elements. When they are added together, they form a <emphasis effect="italics">mixture</emphasis> of iron and sulphur. The iron and sulphur are not joined together. However, if the mixture is heated, a new <emphasis effect="italics">compound</emphasis> is formed, which is called iron sulphide (FeS). In this compound, the iron and sulphur are joined to each other in a ratio of 1:1. In other words, one atom of iron is joined to one atom of sulphur in the compound iron sulphide.</para>

<para id="eip-487"><link target-id="uid27"/> shows the microscopic representation of mixtures and compounds. In a microscopic representation we use circles to represent different elements. To show a compound, we draw several circles joined together. Mixtures are simply shown as two or more individual elements in the same box. The circles are not joined for a mixture.</para>
<para id="id0124">We can also use symbols to represent elements, mixtures and compounds. The symbols for the elements are all found on the periodic table. Compounds are shown as two or more element names written right next to each other. Subscripts may be used to show that there is more than one atom of a particular element. (e.g. <m:math overflow="scroll"><m:mi mathvariant="normal">H</m:mi><m:msub><m:mrow/><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msub><m:mi mathvariant="normal">O</m:mi></m:math> or <m:math><m:mi mathvariant="normal">NaCl</m:mi></m:math>). Mixtures are written as: a mixture of element (or compound) A and element (or compound) B. (e.g. a mixture of <m:math><m:mi mathvariant="normal">Fe</m:mi></m:math> and <m:math><m:mi mathvariant="normal">S</m:mi></m:math>).</para>
<para id="eip-595">One way to think of mixtures and compounds is to think of buildings. The building is a mixture of different building materials (e.g. glass, bricks, cement, etc.). The building materials are all compounds. You can also think of the elements as Lego blocks. Each Lego block can be added to other Lego blocks to make new structures, in the same way that elements can combine to make compounds. </para><exercise id="eip-524"><title>Mixtures and pure substances</title><problem id="eip-259">

      <para id="id65053">When numbers are written as 'subscripts' in compounds (i.e. they are written below and to the right of the element symbol), this tells us how many atoms of that element there are in relation to other elements in the compound. For example in nitrogen dioxide (<m:math><m:msub><m:mi>NO</m:mi><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msub></m:math>) there are two oxygen atoms for every one atom of nitrogen. In sulphur trioxide (<m:math><m:msub><m:mi>SO</m:mi><m:mn>3</m:mn></m:msub></m:math>), there are three oxygen atoms for every one atom of sulphur in the compound.

<para id="eip-163">We can use these rules to help us name both ionic compounds and covalent compounds (more on these compounds will be covered in a later chapter). However, covalent compounds are often given other names by scientists to simplify the name (or because the molecule was named long before its formula was discovered). For example, if we have 2 hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom the above naming rules would tell us that the substance is dihydrogen monoxide. But this compound is better known as water! Or if we had 1 carbon atom and 4 hydrogen atoms then the name would be carbon tetrahydride, but scientists call this compound methane.  </para><exercise id="eip-254"><title>Naming compounds</title><problem id="eip-671">
